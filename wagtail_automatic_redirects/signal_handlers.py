    # page slug. The next part is determining the revision is for draft or
    # published page. For example, an admin user start editing the page
    # (with slug /original) change Url (/original-changed) and save as draft.
    # On next edit, user again change the URL to something else
    # (/original-desired) and then publish the page. So, in this case, redirect
    # should be created from /original to /original-desired. Page object that
    # has has_unpublished_changes value True, is draft revision. Interestingly
